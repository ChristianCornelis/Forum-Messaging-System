ISSUES:
*******

Addauthor program:
-Stream names cannot contains spaces or just be a newline


Viewing Program:
-If the terminal is in full screen (or half screen), then my program will NOT resize it to be 80 x 24
-The 'O' option does not work
-Selecting 'all' to be viewed will print out all of the streams in the order that they appear, one whole stream at a time, each stream being in chronological order
