ISSUES:
*******

-Global class variables will have a constructor to initialize the function pointers found in thye class functions. This will be present directly after the declaration of the global class variable, no matter where it is, which will yield a compilation error if the class hasn't already been defined.

-Method overloading will not work. This is because I did not have time to implement a system that checks the old function name along with it's parameters in order to determine which new function name to switch it with.

-If a class has a function inside of it which includes a semicolon after it, the function name will contain two semicolons in the class definition in the generated C file.

-If a function returns a pointer and the asterisk is attached to the function name, it will be treated as a part of the function name, and will cause problems.



Here is some Beavis and Butthead ASCII art to encourage you to have mercy on me:
